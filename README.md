Problem Statement: 
In an increasingly interconnected digital world, the influence of social media on individuals' 
well-being has become a subject of intense interest. Despite the growing concern about the 
potential impact of social media on mental and physical health, there remains a lack of 
comprehensive understanding regarding the specific relationship between social media usage 
patterns and perceived health. This gap calls for a data-driven analysis to explore how different 
patterns of social media engagement are associated with users' perceptions of their overall well being.
Outcome: 
At the project's conclusion, the analysis will provide insights into the relationships between 
social media usage patterns, perceived health, and the most utilized social media platforms. 
From this analysis, we can potentially predict several key points:
1. Impact on Mental Health: The project can shed light on how specific social media 
behaviors correlate with users' mental well-being, potentially highlighting the risks associated 
with excessive or negative online engagement.
2. Influence of Content Consumption: By examining the correlation between health analysis 
and the types of content consumed, we can predict the influence of certain content types on 
users' health perceptions and emotional states.
3. Prevalent Social Media Platforms: The analysis will reveal which social media platforms are 
predominantly used, allowing for predictions about the popularity of these platforms and 
potential trends in user preferences.
4. Digital Well-being Trends: The project can indicate emerging trends in digital well-being, 
helping to predict the direction of future interventions and initiatives aimed at promoting 
healthier online behaviors and improving overall user experiences.
By leveraging the insights gained from this analysis, we can make informed predictions about 
the potential impact of social media usage on individuals' well-being and contribute to the 
development of strategies that foster a more positive and responsible online environment.
